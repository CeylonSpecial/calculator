About:
This was my fifth and final project of the Foundations portion of The Odin Project.

Assignment:
Put together all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills I learned from Foundations and create an on-screen calculator web app

Objectives:
- create functions for basic math operators
- create a calculator with buttons and display using HTML and CSS
- create functions to populate calculator display when buttons are clicked with mouse/pressed on keyboard
- limit length of solutions to fit in calculator display (I used a rounding function)
- add ability to string together several operations and get correct answer
- add ability to backspace calculator entries
- add ability to clear to clear screen and wipe out existing data
- add ability to use decimals

Reflection:
I felt like I really started to find my stride during this project. I was able to use HTML and CSS to pretty easily build the look of the calculator and I found writing the basic math functions, helper and display functions to be straightforward. I was stumped for a bit on how to store the inputted information but ultimately decided that the best way to do this was to create a calculator object. Though we had not yet covered OOP at this point in the course, I had some prior experience with Python. I looked up how to create objects and this was my first time trying out OOP with JavaScript.
